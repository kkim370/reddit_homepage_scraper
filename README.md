This project is a simple reddit homepage scraper.

You will need to generate a .env file in order to use this program.
Format the .env file as such:
+-------------------------------+
REDDIT_USER = USERNAME HERE
PASSWORD = PASSWORD HERE
+-------------------------------+

This script does have some accuracy errors when it comes to pulling /r/ links so there is an included script to get rid of duplicate links.
